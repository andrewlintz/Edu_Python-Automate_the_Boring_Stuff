Lesson 21: String Formatting

3. Conversion Specifiers


1.
Intro

	In this short lesson we will talk about string formatting. Normally when you want to combine strings together to form a single string value, you can use the plus operator to concatenate strings together. For example you can have 'hello ' plus 'world', and that evaluates to the single strings value: "Hello world". 

		>>> 'hello ' + 'world'
		'hello world'
		
	Now this can get tricky if there are several strings that you need to concatenate. Let's create several variables. 

		>>> name = 'Alice'
		>>> place = 'Main Street'
		>>> time = '6 pm'
		>>> food = 'turnips'
		>>> 'Hello ' + name + ', you are invited to a party at ' + place + ' at ' + time + '. Please bring ' + food + '.'

		'Hello Alice, you are invited to a party at Main Street at 6 pm. Please bring turnips.'

	This expression looks really complicated, we had to type a lot of quotes and a lot of pluses, it's kind of hard to read as well.

String Formatting

	So Python has something called String Formatting. It's also called String Interpolation. And this let's us put a "%s" inside a string to mark where we want to have other strings inserted into it. I'll show you what I mean. 

		>>> 'Hello %s, you are invited to a party at %s at %s. Please bring %s.' 

	And then after that string, we can have "%" followed by parenthesis will have comma delimited list of variables that we want to have inserted at these "%s". 

3. (2:30) 
Conversion Specifiers

	These "%s" are called Conversion Specifiers. So we can have the variable name be assigned and inserted at the first "%s", then we can have place, time, and food. 
	% (name, place, time, food)

		>>> 'Hello %s, you are invited to a party at %s at %s. Please bring %s.' % (name, place, time, food)
		'Hello Alice, you are invited to a party at Main Street at 6 pm. Please bring turnips.'

	And this evaluates to the exact same thing as that huge string concatenation expression evaluated to. Now the the string expression is a lot easier to read. And we can put all the strings that we want to put in it at the end after the % sign. By using String Formatting, you can make your code a lot more readable.
