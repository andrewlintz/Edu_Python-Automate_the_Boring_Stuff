1.

	In this lesson we are going to talk about the .findall() method for Regular Expression Objects. So since we are doing more regular expression work, I'm just going ahead and start off by importing the "re" Module.

	So, we are going to use this in a lot of examples. We are going to create a phone number Regular Expression by calling the re.compile() function, pass it a raw string, and we'll look for a phone number pattern. So we'll have 3 digits for the area code, followed by a dash, followed by 3 more digits, and then for digits. 

		>>> import re
		>>> phoneRegex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')

	And so phoneRegex contains our regular expression object. 

		>>> phoneRegex
		re.compile('\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d')

The findall() Method

	In previous lessons, we called the .search() Method of the Regular Expression dataType. And this would find the first match inside of a string that we searched. But what the findall() Method does, is, it allows us to search a string for all matches of this, (r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d'),  Regular Expression pattern.   

		>>> phoneRegex.findall()

	So let's say we had a whole bunch of text like this one example resume, and I wanted to find all of the phone numbers, that were on the resume.
