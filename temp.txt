	In lesson 7 you learned using for loops to execute a block of code in a certain number of times. 

		>>> for i in range(4):
			print(i)
		0
		1
		2
		3
	This outputs 0,1,2,3. but technically a for loop repeats the code block once for each value in a list, or a list like value.

Range Objects and List-Like Values

	Let's take a closer look at this Range Function

		>>>range(4)
		range(0, 4)

	As you can see, range(4), turns a value into a data type called a "Range Object". And Range Object are a List like values. Python considers, this range object to be similar to the list [0,1,2,3]. In fact you could
