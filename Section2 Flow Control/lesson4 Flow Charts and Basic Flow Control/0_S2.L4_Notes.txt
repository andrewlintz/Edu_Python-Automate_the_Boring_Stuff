1.
Flow Charts
	Start at the Start box, flow the arrows till you get to the end box. You can take a different path depending on different conditions. A flow chart is a good representation of how an execution should move around in a program. 

2.
Flow Control Statements
	Instructions that can decide which python instruction to execute under which conditions.


3.
How to represent the Yes & No Options. 

	Requires: 
	- Boolean Values
	- Comparison Operators
	- Boolean Operators

4.
Boolean Values 
	Data type that only has two values: True & False.  Integers effectively have an infinite number of values. Like any other value, Boolean values are used in expressions and can be stored in variables; just be sure to use Capital T & F and the rest of the word in lower case.  

5.
Comparison Operators

	Operator	Meaning
1.	==		Equal to
2.	!=		Not Equal to
3.	<		Less Than
4.	>		Greater Than
5.	<=		Less than or equal to
6.	>=		Greater than or equal to

	Expressions with Comparison Operators evaluate to a boolean value.

examples:
	42 == 42 		reduces to True
	42 == ‘Hello’ 		reduces to False
	42 == 41		reduces to False
	2 != 3			reduces to True
	42 < 100		reduces to True
	42 > 100		reduces to False
	42 < 42 		reduces to False
	42 <= 42		reduces to True

	myAge	= 26
	myAge < 30		reduces to True

	41 == ’42’		reduces to False

	42.0 == 42		reduces to True

6.
== vs = 

	Equal Operator has 2 equal signs. “is Equal to” has two signs like “Not equal to”
	Variable Assignment Operator has 1 equal sign. Spam = 42

7.
Boolean Operators

	And OR & NOT
8. 
AND Operator

	The AND Operator evaluates an expression to True is both Boolean Values are True, otherwise it evaluates to False. 

	Truth Table: 
		True and True  		evaluates to True
		True and False 		evaluates to False
		False and True 		evaluates to False
		False and False		evaluates to False

9.
OR Operator 	
	
	The OR Operator evaluates an expression to True if either or both of the Boolean Values is True. As long as it’s not False or False, it’ll be True
	
	Truth Table:
		True or True		evaluates to True
		True or False		evaluates to True
		False or True		evaluates to True
		False or False		evaluates to False
10. 
NOT Operator

	The NOT Operator evaluates an express to the opposite Boolean Value. 

	Truth Table
		not True		evaluates to False
		not False 		evaluates to True


	You’ll often mix Boolean Operators & Comparison Operators together in the same expression. 

	myAge = 26
	myPet = ‘cat’
	myAge > 20 and myPet == ‘cat’	evaluates to True


RECAP:

- Boolean Data Type: True, False
- Comparison Operators: ==,!=, <, >, <=, >=
- == is comparison, = is assignment
- Boolean Operators: AND, OR, NOT
