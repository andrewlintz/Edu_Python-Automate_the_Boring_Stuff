Creating your own Functions

	You are already familiar with these functions: 
		print()
		input()
		len()

	Python provides several built-in functions like these, but you can also write your own functions. 

	A Function is like a Mini-program in the program. 
	It contains code that executes when the function is called. Just like your program contains instructions to execute when it is run.

	Let’s look at an example: 

	2_first_own_function_example.py

	- def statment to defined a new function. Whenever we call the function’s name the execution jumps to the top of the function, and executes the code inside of it.  

	- de duplicating code, get rid of duplicate copied paste code. Deduplicating code makes your program shorter, easier to read, and easier to update if theres a bug. 

	When you can the print or the len function, you pass in values called Arguments. These arguments go inbetween the parenthesis.
